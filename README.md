Final Project: Pie Repository

A CS 290 Web Development Project,
Programed by Sean B. Higgins

The purpose of this project is to implement a basic webpage
capable of generating dynamic content and saving user input.

The website itself is a basic site that shows pictures of pies.

Originally, I intended to run the server side code on a
Raspberry Pi 3, but as I lack a monitor and keyboard,
I decided to simply host the server side code on my laptop.
